# eBook Web Application
## About Project
For this application, we implemented the eBook Playlist project. We took a unique spin on this project by utilizing a large book dataset found [​here​](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k). This serves as our online library. A user will be able to create a user id. A user will be able to add the books they like from our database to their booklist. Each user has only one booklist, and users are able to remove books from their booklist. After clicking the button of getting a recommendation book, the system will automatically recommend them a similar book. The recommendation result is a book with a high rating that is randomly selected from the database, so every time the user clicks the Recommend button the result is different.
